== README
Currently if you start this application it will use the [status_client](https://github.com/JiggyPete/status_client) gem to create a new status in the [status](https://github.com/JiggyPete/status) application

To get the application up and running you'll need to run the following
```
bundle install
rails s -p 4000
```
and you will also need to have the [status](https://github.com/JiggyPete/status) application running too.
Instructions for the status application can be found [here]([status](https://github.com/JiggyPete/status) application)
